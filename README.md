# Genetic Algorithm in Odin
A very simple port of an implementation for a Genetic Algorithm for floats genes.

## Description
This is a port to Odin of a simple implementation of a genetic algorithm in C. Latter I, intend to improve the program in terms of better memory management, no leaks and better convergence to the optimal solution, by combining at the end of each generation with run of a simple Hill Climbing algorithm. That is, at each generation use genetic algorithm por global optimization and Hill Climbing for local optimization. The combination of the two methods, will allow to converge much faster, in very low generations, to the optimal solution.

# How to compile

``` bash
$ make opti_max
$ make run
```
